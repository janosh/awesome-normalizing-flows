A list of awesome resources for understanding and applying normalizing flows (NF). It's a relatively simple yet powerful new tool in statistics for constructing expressive probability distributions from simple base distributions using a chain (flow) of trainable smooth bijective transformations (diffeomorphisms).

The only difference is you repeat the following two steps until convergence:
