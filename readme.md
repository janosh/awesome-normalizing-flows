A list of awesome resources for understanding and applying normalizing flows (NF). It's a relatively simple yet powerful new tool in statistics for constructing expressive probability distributions from simple base distribution using a chain (flow) of trainable smooth bijective transformations (diffeomorphisms).

1. Apr 1, 2011 - [Iterative Gaussianization: from ICA to Random Rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00229) by Laparra et. al.

   > Normalizing flows in the form of Gaussianization in an iterative format. Also shows connections to information theory.

2. Oct 30, 2014 - [Non-linear Independent Components Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516) by Laurent Dinh, David Krueger, Yoshua Bengio.

   > Introduces the additive coupling layer (NICE) and shows how to use it for image generation and inpainting.

3. Feb 12, 2015 - [Masked Autoencoder for Distribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509) by Mathieu Germain, Karol Gregor, Iain Murray, Hugo Larochelle.

   > Introduces MADE, a feed-forward network that uses carefully constructed binary masks on its weights to control the precise flow of information through the network. The masks ensure that each output unit receives signals only from input units that come before it in some arbitrary order. Yet all outputs can be computed in a single pass.<br>
   > A popular and efficient method to bestow flows with autoregressivity is to construct them from MADE nets.

This turns the usual diagonal covariance Gaussian into something that allows for multimodality and non-linear dependencies between network parameters.
