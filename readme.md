1. 2023-01-03 - [FInCFlow: Fast and Invertible k √ó k Convolutions for Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09266) by Kallappa, Nagar et al.<br> Invertible convolutions have been an essential element for building expressive normalizing flow-based generative models since their introduction in Glow. Several attempts have been made to design invertible $k \times k$ convolutions that are efficient in training and sampling passes. Though these attempts have improved the expressivity and sampling efficiency, they severely lagged behind Glow which used only $1 \times 1$ convolutions in terms of sampling time. Also, many of the approaches mask a large number of parameters of the underlying convolution, resulting in lower expressivity on a fixed run-time budget. We propose a $k \times k$ convolutional layer and Deep Normalizing Flow architecture which i.)  has a fast parallel inversion algorithm with running time O$(n k^2)$ ($n$ is height and width of the input image and k is kernel size), ii.) masks the minimal amount of learnable parameters in a layer. iii.) gives better forward pass and sampling times comparable to other $k \times k$ convolution-based models on real-world benchmarks. We provide an implementation of the proposed parallel algorithm for sampling using our invertible convolutions on GPUs. Benchmarks on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA datasets show comparable performance to previous works regarding bits per dimension while significantly improving the sampling time.

1. 2022-08-18 - [ManiFlow: Implicitly Representing Manifolds with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08932) by Postels, Danelljan et al.<br>
   The invertibility constraint of NFs imposes limitations on data distributions that reside on lower dimensional manifolds embedded in higher dimensional space. This is often bypassed by adding noise to the data which impacts generated sample quality. This work generates samples from the original data distribution given full knowledge of perturbed distribution and noise model. They establish NFs trained on perturbed data implicitly represent the manifold in regions of maximum likelihood, then propose an optimization objective that recovers the most likely point on the manifold given a sample from the perturbed distribution.

   This work revisits coupling and autoregressive transformations as probabilistic graphical models showing they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology. From this new perspective, the authors propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing flows.

By seeing deterministic maps `x = f(z)` as limiting cases of stochastic maps `x ~ p(x|z)`, the ELBO is reinterpreted as a change of variables formula for the stochastic maps. Moreover, they present a few examples of surjective layers using stochastic maps, which can be composed together with flow layers.

1. 2019-04-09 - [Block Neural Autoregressive Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04676) by Wehenkel, Louppe<br>
   As an alternative to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed NAF, a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural net whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former which is inefficient. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing affine transformations with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and show our flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. [[Code](https://github.com/nicola-decao/BNAF)]

<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/davidinouye/destructive-deep-learning" alt="GitHub repo stars" valign="middle" /><br>
   Code base for the paper [Deep Density Destructors](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/inouye18a.html) by Inouye & Ravikumar (2018). An entire suite of iterative methods including tree-based as well as Gaussianization methods which are similar to normalizing flows except they converge iteratively instead of fully parametrized. That is, they still use bijective transforms, compute the Jacobian, check the likelihood and you can still sample and get probability density estimates. The only difference is you repeat the following two steps until convergence:

1. compute one layer or block layer (e.g. Marginal Gaussianization + PCA rotation)
1. check for convergence (e.g log-likelihood using the change-of-variables formula)

Table 1 in the paper has a good comparison with traditional NFs.
