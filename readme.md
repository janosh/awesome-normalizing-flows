   > Code base for the paper [Deep Density Destructors](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/inouye18a.html) by Inouye & Ravikumar (2018). An entire suite of iterative methods including tree-based as well as Gaussianization methods which are similar to normalizing flows except they converge iteratively instead of fully parametrized. That is, they still use bijective transforms, compute the Jacobian, check the likelihood and you can still sample and get probability density estimates. The only difference is you repeat the following two steps until convergence:
   >
   > 1. compute one layer or block layer (e.g. Marginal Gaussianization + PCA rotation)
   > 2. check for convergence (e.g log-likelihood using the change-of-variables formula)
   >
   > Table 1 in the paper has a good comparison with traditional NFs.
