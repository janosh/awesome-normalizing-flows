   > Features an example of how Normalizing flows can be used to get more robust posteriors from Monte Carlo methods. Uses the `numpyro` library which is a PPL with JAX as the backend. The NF implementations include the basic ones like IAF and BNAF.

   > Code base for the paper [Deep Density Destructors](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/inouye18a.html) by Inouye & Ravikumar (2018). An entire suite of iterative methods including tree-based as well as Gaussianization methods which are similar to normalizing flows except they converge iteratively instead of fully parametrized. That is, they still use bijective transforms, compute the Jacobian, check the likelihood and you can still sample and get probability density estimates. The only difference is you repeat the following two steps until convergence:
   >
   > 1. compute one layer or block layer (e.g. Marginal Gaussianization + PCA rotation)
   > 2. check for convergence (e.g log-likelihood using the change-of-variables formula)
   >
   > Table 1 in the paper has a good comparison with traditional NFs.
