  description: |
    Introduces MADE, a feed-forward network that uses carefully constructed binary masks on its weights to control the precise flow of information through the network. The masks ensure that each output unit receives signals only from input units that come before it in some arbitrary order. Yet all outputs can be computed in a single pass.<br>
    A popular and efficient method to bestow flows with autoregressivity is to construct them from MADE nets.
