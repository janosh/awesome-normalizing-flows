  description: |
    Introduces MADE, a feed-forward network that uses carefully constructed binary masks on its weights to control the precise flow of information through the network. The masks ensure that each output unit receives signals only from input units that come before it in some arbitrary order. Yet all outputs can be computed in a single pass.<br>
    A popular and efficient method to bestow flows with autoregressivity is to construct them from MADE nets.

  authors: Janis Postels, Martin Danelljan, Luc Van Gool, Federico Tombari
  description: The invertibility constraint of NFs imposes limitations on data distributions that reside on lower dimensional manifolds embedded in higher dimensional space. This is often bypassed by adding noise to the data which impacts generated sample quality. This work generates samples from the original data distribution given full knowledge of perturbed distribution and noise model. They establish NFs trained on perturbed data implicitly represent the manifold in regions of maximum likelihood, then propose an optimization objective that recovers the most likely point on the manifold given a sample from the perturbed distribution.
