    Introduces MADE, a feed-forward network that uses carefully constructed binary masks on its weights to control the precise flow of information through the network. The masks ensure that each output unit receives signals only from input units that come before it in some arbitrary order. Yet all outputs can be computed in a single pass.

       A popular and efficient way to make flows autoregressive is to construct them from MADE nets.

  description: The invertibility constraint of NFs imposes limitations on data distributions that reside on lower dimensional manifolds embedded in higher dimensional space. This is often bypassed by adding noise to the data which impacts generated sample quality. This work generates samples from the original data distribution given full knowledge of perturbed distribution and noise model. They establish NFs trained on perturbed data implicitly represent the manifold in regions of maximum likelihood, then propose an optimization objective that recovers the most likely point on the manifold given a sample from the perturbed distribution.

  description: This work revisits coupling and autoregressive transformations as probabilistic graphical models showing they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology. From this new perspective, the authors propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing flows.

  description: As an alternative to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed NAF, a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural net whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former which is inefficient. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing affine transformations with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and show our flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

  description: propose a k√ók convolutional layer and Deep Normalizing Flow architecture which i) has a fast parallel inversion algorithm with running time O(nk^2) (n is height and width of the input image and k is kernel size), ii) masks the minimal amount of learnable parameters in a layer. iii) gives better forward pass and sampling times comparable to other k√ók convolution-based models on real-world benchmarks.

  description: This work proposes the monotone formulation to overcome the issue of the Lipschitz constants in previous ResNet-based normalizing flows using monotone operators and provides an in-depth theoretical analysis. Furthermore, this work constructs an activation function called Concatenated Pila (CPila) to improve gradient flow. The resulting model, Monotone Flows, exhibits an excellent performance on multiple density estimation benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet32, ImageNet64).

  description: Normalizing flows have potential in Bayesian statistics as a complementary or alternative method to MCMC for sampling posteriors. However, their training via reverse KL divergence may be inadequate for complex posteriors. This research proposes a new training approach utilizing direct KL divergence, which involves augmenting a local MCMC algorithm with a normalizing flow to enhance mixing rate and utilizing the resulting samples to train the flow. This method requires minimal prior knowledge of the posterior and can be applied for model validation and evidence estimation, offering a promising strategy for efficient posterior sampling.

  description: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms struggle with sampling from high-dimensional, multimodal distributions, requiring extensive computational effort or specialized importance sampling strategies. To address this, an adaptive MCMC approach is proposed, combining local updates with nonlocal transitions via normalizing flows. This method blends standard transition kernels with generative model moves, adapting the generative model using generated data to improve sampling efficiency. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's ability to equilibrate quickly between metastable modes, sampling effectively across large free energy barriers and achieving significant accelerations over traditional MCMC methods.

  description: Boltzmann Generators, a machine learning method, generate equilibrium samples of molecular systems by learning a transformation from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution via normalizing flows. Recently, flow matching has been used to train Boltzmann Generators for small systems in Cartesian coordinates. This work extends this approach by proposing a framework for transferable Boltzmann Generators that can predict Boltzmann distributions for unseen molecules without retraining. This allows for approximate sampling and efficient reweighting to the target distribution. The framework is tested on dipeptides, demonstrating efficient generalization to new systems and improved efficiency compared to single-system training.
