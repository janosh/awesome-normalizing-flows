  description: |
    Introduces MADE, a feed-forward network that uses carefully constructed binary masks on its weights to control the precise flow of information through the network. The masks ensure that each output unit receives signals only from input units that come before it in some arbitrary order. Yet all outputs can be computed in a single pass.

       A popular and efficient way to make flows autoregressive is to construct them from MADE nets.

  description: The invertibility constraint of NFs imposes limitations on data distributions that reside on lower dimensional manifolds embedded in higher dimensional space. This is often bypassed by adding noise to the data which impacts generated sample quality. This work generates samples from the original data distribution given full knowledge of perturbed distribution and noise model. They establish NFs trained on perturbed data implicitly represent the manifold in regions of maximum likelihood, then propose an optimization objective that recovers the most likely point on the manifold given a sample from the perturbed distribution.

  authors: Antoine Wehenkel, Gilles Louppe
  description: As an alternative to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed NAF, a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural net whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former which is inefficient. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing affine transformations with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and show our flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

  description: Propose a `k x k` convolutional layer and Deep Normalizing Flow architecture which i.)  has a fast parallel inversion algorithm with running time `O(n k^2)` ($n$ is height and width of the input image and k is kernel size), ii.) masks the minimal amount of learnable parameters in a layer. iii.) gives better forward pass and sampling times comparable to other `k x k` convolution-based models on real-world benchmarks. We provide an implementation of the proposed parallel algorithm for sampling using our invertible convolutions on GPUs.
