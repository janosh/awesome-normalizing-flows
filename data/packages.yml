  title: Jammy Flows
  url: https://github.com/thoglu/jammy_flows
  authors: Thorsten Glüsenkamp
  authors_url: https://github.com/thoglu
  lang: PyTorch
  description: A package that models joint (conditional) PDFs on tensor products of manifolds (Euclidean, sphere, interval, simplex) - like inverse autoregressive flows, but connects manifolds, models conditional PDFs, and allows for arbitrary couplings instead of affine ones. Includes a few SOTA flows like Gaussianization flows.
