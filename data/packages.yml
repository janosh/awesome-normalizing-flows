  description: |
    Zuko is a Python package that implements normalizing flows in PyTorch. It relies heavily on PyTorch's built-in distributions and transformations, which makes the implementation concise, easy to understand and extend. The API is fully documented with references to the original papers.

    Zuko is used in [LAMPE](https://github.com/francois-rozet/lampe) to enable Likelihood-free AMortized Posterior Estimation with PyTorch.

  description: A package that models joint (conditional) PDFs on tensor products of manifolds (Euclidean, sphere, interval, simplex) - like inverse autoregressive flows, but connects manifolds, models conditional PDFs, and allows for arbitrary couplings instead of affine ones. Includes a few SOTA flows like Gaussianization flows.
